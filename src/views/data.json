Leukemia Relapse.\nMr. Known lastname 22571 was found on admission to have 90% circulating\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">blasts</span>, consistent with a <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">relapse</span> of his leukemia. He was\ntreated with a cycle of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">decitabine</span> and ultimately started on\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">hydrea</span> for cytoreduction. Discussion regarding donor lymphocyte\ninfusion was started and the patient will follow up with his\nState 792Oncologist and Dr. First Name (STitle) 1557 for further therapy.\n.\n2. Febrile Neutropenia\nOn admission, Mr. Known lastname 22571 had fever and neutropenia. There was\nno obvious source for infection given lack of localizing signs\nor symptoms initially. He did have a portacath which looked\nclean and intact. He was initially started on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">cefepime</span> and\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">vancomycin</span> but continued to spike to 102 with occasional rigors.\nHis initially set of blood cultures had 3-28 bottle of coag\nnegative staph that subsequently cleared after a 14 day course\nof <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">antibiotics</span>. For possibility of fungal infection, he was\ntreated with <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">caspofungin</span>, and this was later broadened to\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">voriconazole</span>. The patient had recurrent bouts of\nfever/hypothermia and hypotension requiring MICU treatment, but\nwas able to be stabilized with fluids and never required\npressors.  On 2125-6-29, the patient cultured out Gram Negative\nRods, that speciated to stenotrophomonas maltophilia. His\nantibiotic regimen was changed to high dose <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">bactrim</span> IV for a\nplanned 2 week course followed by chronic treatment with PO\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">bactrim</span>.\n.\n3. rash- He developed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">maculopapular rash</span> on legs on 2125-6-13-\nnickel size erythematous raised lesions, which were initially\nnon pruritic but became pruritic. There was concern over sweet's\nsyndrome vs. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">leukemia cutis</span>. A <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">dermatology</span> consult was obtained\nand biopsies were taken. The biopsy showed superficial to\nmid-dermal perivascular mixed lymphocytic and eosinophilic\ninfiltrate with atypical mononuclear cells consistent with\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">blasts</span> and red blood cell extravasation. No vasculitis or\nneutrophilic infiltrate is seen. A hypersensitivity reaction\nwith infiltration by circulating leukemic cells is favored,\nhowever if the eruption becomes more prominent, re-biopsy to\nexclude the development of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">leukemia cutis</span> should be considered,\nas clinically appropriate.  Over the course of the\nhospitalization, the rash become less prominent and improved.\n.\n4. Disposition: After a prolonged hospitalization, the patient\nwas <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">discharge</span>d home to complete the IV <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">bactrim</span> course.

Since\nthe previous tracing of 2169-9-17 <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">atrial fibrillation</span> is new.\n\nNONCONTRAST HEAD CT\nThere are two large areas of intraparenchymal hematoma within\nthe left frontal lobe with surrounding hypodensity consistent\nwith extruded serum and edema.  The superior intraparenchymal\nhematoma measures approximately 35 x 22 mm and is adjacent to\nthe frontal convexity. The inferior intraparenchymal hematoma is\nat the junction of the frontotemporal lobe and measures\napproximately 26 x 23 mm.

Given the patient's age,\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">amyloid angiopathy</span> should be considered.\n2. Patchy contrast enhancement within the two larger hematomas\nmay be\nreactive, but should be followed to exclude possibility of\nunderlying masses.\n3.

Head CT done at Good Samarital showed no\nacute process.  He was transferred to Hospital1 18 ED where upon\narrival, his <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">NIHSS</span> was 6, and his BP on arrival\nwas 250/120.  <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">CT scan</span> showed L frontal IPH, right ICA occlusion,\nand patent L\nICA stent.  His exam was significant for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">expressive aphasia</span> and\nright facial droop. He was admitted to the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">neuro ICU</span> for blood\npressure control and monitoring. He was intubated for airway\nprotection and hyperventilation to reduce <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">intracranial pressure</span>.\nHe was on nicardipine drip for BP. He received <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">mannitol</span> and\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">hypertonic saline</span> to reduce ICP. On hospital day 5, repeat head\nCT appeared stable. Patient was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">extubated</span> and transferred to the\nneurology floor.\n\nOn the floor, the patient's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">mental status</span> gradually improved. He\nbecame more alert, interactive, follows commands inconsistently,\nbut remained with expressive more than receptive aphasia. He\nremained with 4/5 weakness on the right. He was able to ambulate\nwith 2 assist, walker, and safety belt.\n\nThe etiology of his ICH was felt to be primary lobar hemorrhage\ndue to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">amyloid angiopathy</span>.

Missing key information:\n   - The summary does not mention the patient's initial presentation and symptoms at the first hospital (Good Samaritan Hospital), such as the specific details of the expressive aphasia and right facial droop.\n   - The summary does not provide details on the patient's neurological exam findings, including the NIHSS score, upon arrival at the second hospital ([**Hospital1 18**]).\n   - The summary does not mention the specific treatment interventions used to manage the elevated intracranial pressure, such as the use of mannitol and hypertonic saline.\n   - The summary does not include the results of the MRI brain, which provided additional information about the extent of the hemorrhage and the suspected underlying etiology of amyloid angiopathy.\n   - The summary does not mention the patient's code status and the decision to make him DNR but not DNI during the hospitalization.\n\n2. Inaccuracies or inconsistencies:\n   - The summary states that the patient was \"found to have left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) and right internal carotid artery occlusion,\" but the original note indicates that the CT scan showed \"L frontal IPH, right ICA occlusion, and patent L ICA stent.\"\n   - The summary mentions that the patient was \"extubated, showing gradual improvement in mental status and mobility,\" but the discharge condition states that the patient's mental status was \"Confused - always.\"\n\n3. Adequacy of capturing the essential aspects of the patient's hospital stay:\n   - The summary adequately captures the reason for admission (new-onset expressive aphasia), the significant findings (left frontal IPH and right ICA occlusion), and the overall hospital course, including the management of elevated intracranial pressure and the patient's gradual improvement.\n   - However, as mentioned earlier, the summary lacks some key details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's presentation, treatment, and discharge condition.\n\n4. Suggestions for improvement:\n   - Incorporate the missing key information identified in the first point, such as the initial presentation and symptoms, detailed neurological exam findings, specific treatment interventions, and the MRI brain results.\n   - Ensure consistency between the summary and the original note, particularly regarding the details of the radiological findings and the patient's discharge condition.\n   - Consider restructuring the summary to follow a more logical flow, such as separating the sections for the intracranial hemorrhage, the right ulnar/radial fracture, and the management of hypertension.\n   - Enhance the clarity and conciseness of the summary by using more precise language and avoiding redundant information.\n\nOverall, the summary provides a reasonable overview of the patient's hospital stay, but it could be improved by including additional key details, addressing the identified inaccuracies, and enhancing the overall organization and clarity of the information presented.",

There are no apparent inaccuracies or inconsistencies between the original note and the summary.\n\n3. Adequacy of the summary:\n   - The summary adequately captures the essential aspects of the patient's hospital stay, including the radiographic findings and the potential differential diagnoses (hydrostatic pulmonary edema or viral/atypical pneumonia).\n   - However, as mentioned earlier, the summary lacks important information about the patient's presenting symptoms, medical history, and other clinical data that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition and the rationale for the diagnostic workup.\n\n4. Suggested improvements:\n   - Expand the summary to include the patient's presenting symptoms, relevant medical history, and any other pertinent clinical information that may have contributed to the decision-making process.\n   - Provide more details about the patient's clinical status, such as vital signs, physical examination findings, and any other laboratory or diagnostic test results that may have been obtained.\n   - Clearly state the reason for the hospital admission and the initial working diagnosis or differential diagnosis.\n   - Describe the hospital course, including any interventions or treatments provided, and the patient's response to these measures.\n   - Summarize the discharge plan, including any follow-up recommendations or instructions for the patient.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, the clinical note summary will provide a more comprehensive and informative overview of the patient's hospital stay, allowing for better continuity of care and improved communication among healthcare providers.",

Abdominal pain, fever: The patient's initial presentation\nwas concerning for ascending cholangitis, although his perc\ndrain was in place and extending through the duodenum. There was\npersistant elevation in bilirubin concerning for obstructed\ndrainage.  External biliary drain was uncapped by interventional\nradiology on 2-23 and left draining externally.  Persistant mild\nto moderate intra and extra hepatic biliary duct dilation was\nalso seen.  The proximal sideport of the drain was withdrawn for\nbetter drainage of intrahepatic ducts and the patients LFTs and\nobstructive picture improved over the course of the\nhospitalization.  There was significant leukocytosis on\nadmission and given his prior reaction to cipro and flagyl the\npatient was initially managed on IV Unasyn.  This was\ntransitioned to Augmentin with good tolerance.  The patient had\nlow grade temperatures to 99 during the course of his stay\nhowever on 2-28 the patient became <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">febrile to 101.5</span> while on po\nabx.  He was pan-cultured and a PICC line was placed for\n<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">transition to Zosyn for a 10 day course</span> to be completed as an\noutpatient.\n    The patient's pain was felt to be secondary to the external\ndrain as well as the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">pancreatic mass</span> and liver lesions.  He was\nadequately managed on MS Contin with oxycodone for breakthrough.\n Tylenol was avoided during his stay given his hepatic\ninvolvement and NSAIDs were minimized secondary to frequent\nplanned interventions.  A bowel regimen was given while on\nnarcotics.\n\n\n2. Pancreatic head mass: The EUS FNA biopsy was consistent with\ncarcinoma with neuroendocrine features.  The official read of\npathology is pending as of this dictation.  A liver biopsy was\nobtained via CT guidance to evaluate for metastatic disease.\nThose results are pending as well.  The patient will follow up\nwith Dr. Last Name (STitle)  next week.

An <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">MRI</span> revealed an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">aneurysmal dilation of the left MCA bifurcation</span>. On July 30, she underwent a <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">left-sided craniotomy</span> for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">clipping of the MCA aneurysm</span>, which was successful with <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">no intraoperative complications</span>.

Inaccuracies or inconsistencies:\n   - The summary states that the patient was admitted from July 29 to August 1, 2110, while the original note indicates the admission date as July 30, 2110.\n   - The summary mentions that the patient experienced \"some swelling around her left eye\" postoperatively, but the original note provides more details, stating that she had \"significant swelling of her left eye\" and was given ice bags and tea bags to help with the swelling.\n\n3. Adequacy of capturing the essential aspects of the patient's hospital stay:\n   - The summary adequately captures the reason for admission (left MCA aneurysm), the surgical intervention (left-sided craniotomy for aneurysm clipping), and the overall postoperative course (stable, alert, and neurologically intact).\n   - However, the summary lacks important details about the patient's preoperative symptoms, diagnostic workup, and postoperative management, which are present in the original note.\n\n4. Suggestions for improvement:\n   - The summary should include the patient's past medical history, particularly the history of allergy-induced asthma and migraines, as these may be relevant to the patient's overall health and management.\n   - The summary should provide more details about the diagnostic cerebral angiogram that led to the diagnosis of the left MCA aneurysm.\n   - The summary should include the patient's vital signs and laboratory results from the postoperative period, as these provide important information about the patient's clinical course and recovery.\n   - The summary should be more consistent with the details provided in the original note, especially regarding the timing of admission and the extent of postoperative swelling.\n   - The summary could be enhanced by including a brief description of the patient's hospital course, such as the timeline of events, any significant complications or interventions, and the patient's progress towards discharge.\n\nOverall, the summary provides a general overview of the patient's hospital stay, but it lacks some key details and is not entirely consistent with the information provided in the original clinical note.

Here is my assessment and recommendations:\n\n1. Missing key information:\n   - The summary does not mention the reason for the patient's admission to the MICU.\n   - There is no information about the patient's medical history, underlying conditions, or any relevant past medical history.\n   - The summary does not provide any details about the patient's vital signs, laboratory findings, or other significant clinical data that may have contributed to the current condition.\n   - The summary does not mention any interventions or treatments provided to the patient, other than the initiation of comfort measures and medication orders.\n\n2. Inaccuracies or inconsistencies:\n   - The summary and the original note are generally consistent, with minor differences in wording and formatting.\n   - However, the original note mentions that the patient is exhibiting \"rapid breathing,\" while the summary states that the patient is \"on a 100% face mask and is exhibiting rapid breathing.\" This could imply that the rapid breathing is a result of the oxygen therapy, which may not be the case.\n\n3. Adequacy of the summary:\n   - The summary provides a brief overview of the patient's current condition, including the fact that the patient remains unresponsive and that comfort measures have been initiated.\n   - However, the summary does not adequately capture the essential aspects of the patient's hospital stay, such as the reason for admission, significant findings, and the overall hospital course.\n   - The discharge plan is not mentioned in the summary, which is an important aspect to include.\n\n4. Suggested improvements:\n   - Expand the summary to include the reason for the patient's admission to the MICU, the patient's medical history, and any relevant clinical data (vital signs, laboratory findings, etc.) that may have contributed to the current condition.\n   - Clarify the relationship between the patient's rapid breathing and the oxygen therapy, to ensure accurate representation of the clinical situation.\n   - Include details about any other interventions or treatments provided to the patient, beyond the initiation of comfort measures and medication orders.\n   - Incorporate the patient's discharge plan, if available, to provide a more comprehensive overview of the patient's hospital stay.\n   - Ensure the summary is concise and focused on the essential information, while maintaining clarity and accuracy.\n\nOverall, the clinical note summary provides a limited snapshot of the patient's condition, and additional information is needed to fully capture the essential aspects of the patient's hospital stay. By addressing the identified gaps and inconsistencies, and enhancing the clarity and conciseness of the summary, the clinical note can be improved to better support patient care and communication.",
